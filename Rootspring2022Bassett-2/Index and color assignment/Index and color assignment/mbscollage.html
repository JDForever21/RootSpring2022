        <p style="color: white;">For this project, I was told to create a 3 portrait self collage of the mind, body, and
            spirit. I was only able to find photos off the internet and combine them to create a
            photomontage. For the Mind, I wanted to create myself as how I feel within my mind and
            that is mostly lonely and afraid of being alone. For the body, I wanted others to feel
            the pain I have been through, as if I’m being drained every single day. My spirit shows
            as if I am invincible and no one can stop me. My overall vision was so that each one
            could appear individual, but could also work together in some way, especially with the
            dark cool colors I used in every project.
            I had some issues with the body project. I wanted to show how drained I felt ever
            since a traumatic event I had to go through. I feel as if it is never ending. In my
            project, I appeared to show just that, but it never looked right until the ending when I
            added more overflowing fog to her head. Then once I figured out how to do that, it
            looked perfect to me. My visions for the other two projects came to be about how I
            wanted them before. I didn’t need to make any revisions until the very end to make the
            colors in the fog and and background more of a cool color to try and combine it with the
            theme for the entirety of the project.
            In the end, I am very happy with the end results of all three of my projects and just
            how cool they looked when put together. I will admit that this was a difficult project,
            but one that I took with creativity and pride.</p>
